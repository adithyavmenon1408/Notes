Session			--L5 -- Provides services to the presentation layer organize its dialoge and manage data exchange
Transport		--L4 -- defines services to segment transfer and reassemble data	
Network			--L3 -- Provides services to exchange individual pieces of data over a network
Datalink		--L2 -- Defines the methods for exchanges data frames between devices over a common media

Heirarchical Network Design
---------------------------
Access Layer -- Contains devices that connect to the end user
Distribution Layer - Interconnects the smaller local networks
Core layer - Provides high speed connection between distribution layer devices

dividing a network limits the amount the broadcast traffic. A network can be divided based on 
-->security requirements
-->logical grouping
-->Physical locations

DHCP - Dynamic host configuration protocol.
--> IN home networks modem acts as both  DHCP client and router. It receives the public IP address
	from the ISP and acts as a DHCP server for the inetrnal hosts by distributing private IPs
	
--> In DHCPv6 there is no default gateway address. This is obtained from the router advertisment msg of the
	router

DHCP operation

--> Host sends out a DHCP discover packet (broadcast packet). Contains the MAC adddr of the device
	requesting the dhcp 
--> DHCP server responds with a DHCP offer. contains an IP addr, subnet mask and default gateway address that the requesting host can use 
	if it accepts it.
--> Host sends a DHCP request (broadcast message) packet to the DHCP server to request for the IP address the server had offerred
--> DHCP server sends back an acknowledgment packet indicating to that host that it has assigned the requested IP
	to the MAC address of the requesting host.

Private IPv4 addresses have the following class configurations:

-->	Class A IP addresses. Configurations range from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255. 
	This class is for large networks and has 8 bits for the network and 24 bits for hosts.

--> Class B IP addresses. Configurations range from 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255. 
	This class is for medium networks and has 16 bits for the network and 16 bits for hosts.

--> Class C IP addresses. Configurations range from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255. 
	This class is for smaller networks and has 24 bits for the network and 8 bits for hosts.
	
Network address translation  NAT

--> Router keeps a table in which the Private IP address is mapped to a public ip address
--> Router substitutes the private IP with the public IP address when the host wants to communicate with the remote network
--> Data from the remote network comes back to the public IP address. The router then convertst the IP
	back to the private IP before sending the packet to the requesting host
	
Need for IPv6

--> increasing internet population
--> decreasing IPv4 address space
--> issues with NAT
--> IOT

IPv6 has an address size of 340 undecillion = 340 * 10^36
Ipv6 is represented as ': separated hexa decimal form' = [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F]
IPv6 is a 128 bit address (consists of 128 1s and 0s) while IPv4 is only 32 bit (contains 32 1s & 0s)
IPv6 consists of 8 hextets (8 groups of 16 bits)
IPv6 has network prefix instead of subnet mask. This network prefix tells us how to id the network
	with a network prefix of 64, itb means that the first 64 bits are the network protion of the IPv6 address
Contiguous zeroes can be replaced with a double colon in IPv6, but this can be used only once in an address

IPv6 Migration Techniques

--> Dual Stack = allows IPv4 and IPv6 to exist simulateously. Devices run both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks
				 simultaneously. Known as native IPv6, this means the customer network has an IPv6 connection to its ISP 
				 and is able to access content found on the internet over IPv6.

--> Tunnelling = This is a method of transporting an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network. The IPv6 packet is encapsulated inside an IPv4 packet, 
				 similar to other types of data.
				 
--> TRanslation = This uses the NAT64 protocol to allow an IPv6 only network to communicate with the IPv4 Network
				  An IPv6 packet is translated to an IPv4 packet and an IPv4 packet is translated to an IPv6 packet.
				  
IPv6 makes use of link local unicast address (usually begins with FE80). This is an address that can only  be used on a particular network.
It is not routed by the router. other networks cannot see this address.

ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol

Inorder for a host on an ipv6 network to get a global unicast IPv6 address it first sends  the router solicitation (multicast) packet using the ICMPv6 protocol.
Any IPv6 routers on the network that receives the router solicitation responds with a router advertisment (multicast) packet that contains the addressing information that 
the host uses to create its own global unicast address. Router advertisment has 3 options

--> SLAAC - stateless address auto configuration = using this the host can create its own address. DHCPv6 is not used
--> SLAAC + Stateless DHCPv6 for DNS addresses = addressing  info for creating the global unicast address comes from SLAAC but the DNS address comes from stateless DHCPv6 server
--> DHCPv6 (stateful) = gives all addressing information except default gateway address. In IPv6 instead of default gateway link local address is used and this is provided by the 
	router.

A socket is one end point of a 2 way communication between 2 programs running on a network. and end point is a combination of IP address and port number
Client  and server will have their own sockets

UDP -- Primarily used with real time applications like streaming. loss of a few packets along the way is not  of much concern. This is less reliable. Each segment has a source and 
	   destination port number but  no sequence number or acknowledgement of receipt of the packet.
	   
TCP -- Primarily used when loss of packets can cause catastrophic side effects. This is  more reliable than UDP. This ensures that only  very limited number of packets are dropped
	   and if any packet is dropped by chance, it is picked up and retransmitted. In TCP each  segment has a sequence number in addition to source and destination port number.
	   Sequence number helps to ensure that each segment has reached safely and any  missing segment is identified by the sequence number and then retransmitted. In this
	   the client and ther server are in conatant communication and each time a segement is received an acknowledgement is sent. this causes some overhead. The sequence number allow
	   the client to put the packets back in its original order

Depending on the critical nature of the information being sent, an appropriate protocol is chosen from TCP or UDP

HTTP - 80
HTTPS - 443
DNS -53
TELNET -23
SMTP - 25
POP3 - 110
IMAP - 143
DHCP - 67 (server)
DHCP - 68 (client) 
TFTP - 69

SMTP - used to send email  to the local mail swrver which then decides whether to  forwrd the mail to another email server on the same domain or not
POP - used to receive emails. emails are downloded on to the users system once he connects using the pop client
IMAP -used to receive emails. emails are stored on the mail server for future use by the users and a copy is downloaded on to the users system

An FTP client is an application that runs on a computer used to push and pull files from a server running an FTP daemon. To transfer files, FTP requires two connections 
between the client and the server: one for commands and replies and another for the actual file transfer. The client establishes the first connection to the server for 
control traffic and the second connection for the actual file transfer. 





Port forwarding - this is a way of making the router use a specific port to communicate with certain devices. this way the traffic does not have access to the other devices
				  on the network.

CISCO DEVICES
				  
Out of band configuration of a switch requires it to  be directly connected to a computer through a rollover cable. This will allow access to the device without haveing any network
connection.
Inband management involves remotely accessing the network device. This requires a network connection. Either Telnet, HTTP or SSH can be used to access a Cisco device for in-band 
management, monitor the network device, or make configuration changes.

When a cisco device boots up the IOS IMAGE FILE and the STARTUP CONFIguration FILE are loaded on to the RAM
IOS IMGAFE FILE is stored in the flash memory and it facilitates the operation of the devices hardware.
--> Flash memory is not the same as RAM. IT retains the data even when the power is off. but it's just as fast as RAM
The start up configuration file is stored in the NVRAM (Non Volatile RAM ). All config changes are stored in the running file and implemented immediately by the IOS.

Routers are essentially computers and have the folowing components
--> OS
--> RAM
--> ROM
--> CPU
--> NVRAM

Steps to boot a router involves (POST --> load Bootstrap --> LOad IOS --> LOad Configuration file)
--> Mount the router on a rack
--> Ground the router
--> Connect the power cable
--> connect the console cable (rollover cable)
--> Switch on the router
--> Observe the startup messages on the terminal

Copy of a limited IOS for trouble shooting is stored in ROM

There are 2 primamry CLI access modes for any cisco device.
1) User Exec Mode - In this the capabilities are limkited. Only basic monitoring operations can be performed. It does not allow the execution of any command that can change the
					confoguration of the device. CLI prompt ends with '>' symbol
2) Privilaged Exec Mode - In this all advanced operations including monitoring and configuration changes are permitted. CLI prompt ends with '#' symbol
						  Higher configuration modes like the global config mode can be reached from here.
--> Enable command allows to switch from user exec to privilage exec modes.
--> configure terminal command allows to  enter the global config mode
--> disable brings back to user exec mode
--> ? is helps
--> Ctrl+z / end brings us back ro privilaged exec mode
--> line console 0 -- user exec mode
--> line vty 0 15 -- ssh/telnet access
--> interface vlan 1 -- configure management svi
--> ip address 192.168.10.10 255.255.255.0
--> transport input ssh telnet -- enables telnet and ssh access
